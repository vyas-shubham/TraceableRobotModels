# TraceableRobotModels

The aim of this repository is to create a location where robot models (in URDF format) can be shared which are traceable using published literature.

If any mistakes are found in the URDF models, a pull request can be made outlining the mistake and explaining the corrections along with sources. This creates a traceable source for robot models which can be used in research.

Current models available:

- ETS-VII
