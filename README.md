# TraceableRobotModels

The aim of this repository is to create a location where robot models (in URDF format) can be shared which are traceable using published literature.

If any mistakes are found in the URDF models, a pull request can be made outlining the mistake and explaining the corrections along with sources. This creates a traceable source for robot models which can be used in research. Similarly, pull requests can be made to add robot URDF models along with the sources used to create the mode.

Current models available:

- ETS-VII
- SRMS/Canadarm
